"It is difficult to keep deep wounds free of bacteria. Even strong antibiotics fail to kill the bacteria that live in such wounds. However, many physicians have succeeded in eliminating bacteria from deep wounds by packing the wound with a sweet substance like sugar.","Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why treating deep wounds with sugar as described above is successful?","["Bacteria that live in deep wounds thrive in a moist environment, and sugar has a dehydrating effect.", "Sugar that is nearly pure is readily available for use in medical treatments.", "Many kinds of bacteria can use sugar as a nutrient and will reproduce rapidly when sugar is available to them.", "Some foods that contain sugar can weaken the effects of certain antibiotics.", "Strong antibiotics were developed only recently, but the use of sugar as a treatment for wounds dates back to ancient times."]",0,199106_3-LR1_1_1
"People who are red/green color-blind cannot distinguish between green and brown. Gerald cannot distinguish between green and brown. Therefore Gerald is red/green color-blind.","Which one of the following most closely parallels the reasoning in the argument presented in the passage?","["People who are fair-skinned suffer from sunburn. William is fair-skinned. Therefore William suffers from sunburn.", "People who are suffering from sinusitis lose their sense of smell. Mary has lost her sense of smell. Therefore Mary is suffering from sinusitis.", "People who have suffered from jaundice cannot become blood donors. Jean is a blood donor. Therefore Jean has not suffered from jaundice.", "People who are color-blind cannot become airline pilots. Arthur is color-blind. Therefore Arthur cannot become an airline pilot.", "People who are diabetic cannot eat large amounts of sugar. Freda is diabetic. Therefore Freda is on a special diet."]",1,199106_3-LR1_2_2
"Early in this century Alfred Wegener developed the concept of continental drift. His ideas were rejected vehemently because he postulated no identifiable force strong enough to make the continents move. We have come to accept Wegener's theory, not because we have pinpointed such a force, but because new instruments have finally allowed continental movement to be confirmed by observation.","The passage best illustrates which one of the following statements about science?","["The aim of science is to define the manifold of nature within the terms of a single harmonious theory.", "In accepting a mathematical description of nature, science has become far more accurate at identifying underlying forces.", "The paradox of science is that every improvement in its measuring instruments seems to make adequate theories harder to work out.", "Science, employing statistics and the laws of probability, is concerned not with the single event but with mass behavior.", "When the events a theory postulates are detected, the theory is accepted even without an explanation of how those events are brought about."]",4,199106_3-LR1_3_3
"The theory of military deterrence was based on a simple psychological truth, that fear of retaliation makes a would-be aggressor nation hesitate before attacking and is often sufficient to deter it altogether from attacking. Clearly, then, to maintain military deterrence, a nation would have to be believed to have retaliatory power so great that a potential aggressor nation would have reason to think that it could not defend itself against such retaliation.","If the statements above are true, which one of the following can be properly inferred?","["A would-be aggressor nation can be deterred from attacking only if it has certain knowledge that it would be destroyed in retaliation by the country it attacks.", "A nation will not attack another nation if it believes that its own retaliatory power surpasses that of the other nation.", "One nation's failing to attack another establishes that the nation that fails to attack believes that it could not withstand a retaliatory attack from the other nation.", "It is in the interests of a nation that seeks deterrence and has unsurpassed military power to let potential aggressors against it become aware of its power of retaliatory attack.", "Maintaining maximum deterrence from aggression by other nations requires that a nation maintain a retaliatory force greater than that of any other nation."]",3,199106_3-LR1_4_4
"To the Editor: In 1960, an astronomer proposed a mathematical model for determining whether extraterrestrial life exists. It was based on the assumptions that life as we know it could exist only on a planet and that many stars are, like our Sun, orbited by planets. On the basis that there are nine planets in our solar system and one of them has life as we know it, the astronomer predicted that there are as many as one million extraterrestrial civilizations across all solar systems. Yet astronomers to date have not detected even one planet outside our solar system. This indicates that the astronomer's model is wrong, and life as we know it exists only on the planet Earth. Clay Moltz.","Which one of the following, if accepted by Clay Moltz, would require him to reconsider his conclusion?","["Forms of life other than life as we know it exist on other planets.", "There are many stars that are not orbited by planets.", "Detecting planets outside our solar system requires more sophisticated instruments than are currently available.", "The soundness of the conclusion reached by applying a mathematical model depends on the soundness of the assumptions on which the model is based.", "Due to sheer distances and expanses of space involved, any extraterrestrial civilization would have great difficulty communicating with ours."]",2,199106_3-LR1_5_5
"If Max were guilty, he would not ask the police to investigate. Therefore, his asking the police to investigate shows that he is not guilty.","The logical structure of the argument above is most similar to which one of the following?","["If Lucille were in the next room, I would not be able to see her. Therefore, the fact that I can see her shows that she is not in the next room.", "If Sam were rich, he would not spend his vacation in Alaska. Therefore, his spending his vacation in the Bahamas shows that he is rich.", "If Joe were over 40 he would not want to learn to ski. Therefore, the fact that he does not want to learn to ski shows that he is over 40.", "If Mark were a good cook, he would not put cinnamon in the chili.

"A population of game ducks at a western lake contains 55 males to every 45 females, while a population of game ducks at an eastern lake contains 65 males for every 35 females. Among those ducks that have not yet bred there are only slightly more males than females, but among older ducks the number of males greatly exceeds the number of females. Because there are appreciably more males among adult ducks than among young ducks, we can infer that the greater the disparity in overall sex ratios, the greater the percentage of older male ducks in the population.","Which one of the following can be inferred from the passage?","["The population of game ducks at the western lake contains a lower percentage of adult males than the population at the eastern lake contains.", "The population of game ducks at the eastern lake contains a higher percentage of nonadult game ducks than the population at the western lake contains.", "The total number of male game ducks is higher in the eastern lake's population than in the western lake's population.", "The number of nonadult ducks hatched in a breeding season is higher in the eastern lake's population than in the western lake's population.", "Adult female game ducks outnumber nonadult female game ducks in the eastern lake's population."]",0,199106_3-LR1_7_7
"The common procedure for determining whether a food additive should be banned from use is to compare its health-related benefits with its potential risks. Yellow Dye No. 5, an additive used to color lemon soda, might cause allergic reactions in a few consumers. For most consumers of lemon soda, however, the coloring enhances their enjoyment of the beverage. This particular additive should not be banned, therefore, because its benefits greatly outweigh its risks.","A flaw in the argument is that the author","["implies that the dye entails no health-related risks", "treats enjoyment of a beverage as a health-related benefit", "ignores the possibility that some food additives are harmful to most people", "bases the argument on an unproven claim regarding a danger in using Yellow Dye No. 5", "presumes that most consumers heed the warning labels on beverage containers"]",1,199106_3-LR1_8_8
"Fines levied against those responsible for certain environmentally damaging accidents are now so high that it costs a company responsible for such an accident more to pay the fine than it would have cost to adopt measures that would have prevented the accident. Therefore, since businesses value their profits, those that might have such accidents will now install adequate environmental safeguards.","Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?","["Businesses generally greatly underestimate the risk of future accidents.", "Businesses are as concerned with long-term as they are with short-term strategies for maximizing profits.", "Businesses generally do the environmentally \"right\" thing only if doing so makes good business sense.", "Businesses treat fines that are levied against them as an ordinary business expense.", "Businesses are learning to exploit the public's environmental awareness in promoting themselves."]",0,199106_3-LR1_9_9
"Even in a democracy, it is necessary to restrict the dissemination of advanced technological knowledge that is of commercial or national-security value. Dissemination to certain countries, those that are or will be competitors or enemies, should be selectively prohibited. There must, however, be free exchange of scientific information.","In order to act in accordance with the position above, it would be necessary to be able to rely on each of the following EXCEPT:","["It is possible to distinguish with confidence, despite any changes in the international environment, friendly or noncompetitive from hostile or competitive nations.", "In a democracy, it is not necessary that the public have detailed knowledge of the country's advanced technology in order, for example, to make informed decisions about the direction public policy should take.", "In most fields of science, basic scientific research is further advanced in countries that are democracies than in countries that are not democracies.", "In each field of science, it is possible to distinguish scientific information from advanced technological knowledge that is of commercial or national-security value.", "In cases where a company that uses advanced technology is a multinational organization, it is possible to keep information about the technology from being passed across designated national boundaries."]",2,199106_3-LR1_10_10
"Water vapor evaporated from the ocean contains a greater proportion of oxygen-16 and a smaller proportion of the heavier oxygen-18 than does seawater. Normally, this phenomenon has no effect on the overall composition of the ocean, because evaporated seawater returns to the ocean through precipitation. During an ice age, however, a large amount of precipitation falls on ice caps, where it is trapped as ice.","Which one of the following conclusions about a typical ice age is most strongly supported by the statements above?","["The proportions of oxygen-16 and oxygen-18 are the same in vapor from seawater as in the seawater itself.", "The concentration of oxygen-18 in seawater is increased.", "Rain and snow contain relatively more oxygen-16 than they do in interglacial periods.", "During the ice age, more of the Earth's precipitation falls over land than falls over the ocean.", "The composition of seawater changes more slowly than it does in interglacial periods."]",1,199106_3-LR1_11_11
"Some of the most prosperous nations in the world have experienced a pronounced drop in national savings rates—the percentage of after-tax income an average household saves. This trend will undoubtedly continue if the average age of these nations' populations continues to rise, since older people have fewer reasons to save than do younger people.","Which one of the following indicates an error in the reasoning leading to the prediction above?","["It fails to specify the many reasons younger people have for saving money, and it fails to identify which of those reasons is the strongest.", "It assumes that a negative savings rate—the result of the average household's spending all of its after-tax income as well as some of its existing savings—cannot ever come about in any nation.", "It fails to cite statistics showing that the average age of the population of certain nations is rising.", "It only takes into account the comparative number of reasons older and younger people, respectively, have for saving, and not the comparative strength of those reasons.", "It uses after-tax income as the base for computing the national savings rate without establishing by argument that after-tax income is a more appropriate base than before-tax income."]",3,199106_3-LR1_12_12
"The term "pit bull" does not designate a breed of dog, as do the terms "German shepherd" and "poodle." It is like the terms "Seeing-Eye dog" and "police dog," which designate dogs according to what they do. If you take two German shepherds and place them side by side, you cannot tell by appearance alone which is the police dog and which is the Seeing-Eye dog.","Which one of the following is the main point of the passage?","["German shepherds can be pit bulls.", "Pit bulls can be distinguished from other kinds of dogs by appearance alone.", "A dog is a pit bull because of what it does, not because of its breed.", "German shepherds can function both as police dogs and as Seeing-Eye dogs.", "Some breeds of dogs cannot be distinguished from other breeds of dogs by appearance alone."]",2,199106_3-LR1_13_13
"Historically, monetary systems have developed only in population centers with marketplaces. Through the fourth century B.C., Mesopotamian cities engaged in trade, but had never had marketplaces. By that period, however, Greek cities all had marketplaces, or agorae. The Greek cities' agorae were centrally located and goods were traded there either for money or for commodities.","If all of the statements in the passage are true, then which one of the following must also be true?","["In the fourth century B.C., Greek cities were the only population centers with monetary systems.", "The development of monetary systems has historically led to the development of marketplaces.", "In the fourth century B.C., the Greeks and the Mesopotamians traded with each other.", "After the fourth century B.C., Mesopotamian cities had marketplaces and monetary systems.", "The Mesopotamian cities of the fourth century B.C. did not have monetary systems."]",4,199106_3-LR1_14_14
"Computer operating system software has become increasingly standardized. But when a large business with multiple, linked computer systems uses identical operating system software on all of its computers, a computer vandal who gains access to one computer automatically has access to the data on all the computers. Using a program known as a "virus," the vandal can then destroy much of the data on all the computers. If such a business introduced minor variations into its operating system software, unauthorized access to all the computers at the same time could be virtually eliminated. Furthermore, variations in operating system software can be created without any loss of computer compatibility to the business. Therefore, it is advisable for businesses to implement such variations.","Which one of the following, if true, supports the conclusion in the passage?","["Standardization of computer operating system software has increased computer compatibility among different businesses.", "Correcting any damage resulting from an invasion by a computer virus program is more expensive than preventing the damage.", "It is not costly for a business to maintain incompatible computer operating systems.", "There are other kinds of destructive computer programs that do not depend on intercomputer links.", "Not all businesses need to share data among their internal computer systems."]",1,199106_3-LR1_15_15

"It is the mark of a superior conductor that he or she has the authority to insist, even with a top orchestra, that rehearsal work must be intensified. This authority cannot simply be claimed; the conductor must earn it by winning the orchestra's respect for the artistic interpretations he or she is currently pursuing.","In taking the position outlined, the author presupposes which one of the following?","["Superior conductors devise different interpretations of a composition for each orchestra with which they perform it.", "Superior conductors are perfectionists who are never satisfied with any performance even by a top orchestra.", "Top orchestras are always ready to put in additional work on rehearsals if the conductor considers additional rehearsing necessary.", "Top orchestras can appreciate the merits of an interpretation even before they have brought it to full realization.", "Even top orchestras are not always led by superior conductors."]",3,199106_3-LR1_16_17
"In the United States proven oil reserves—the amount of oil considered extractable from known fields—are at the same level as they were ten years ago.

"The energy an animal must expend to move uphill is proportional to its body weight, whereas the animal's energy output available to perform this task is proportional to its surface area. This is the reason that small animals, like squirrels, can run up a tree trunk almost as fast as they can move on level ground, whereas large animals tend to slow down when they are moving uphill.","Which one of the following is an assumption on which the explanation above depends?","["The amount of energy needed to move uphill is no greater for large animals than it is for small animals.", "Small animals can move more rapidly than large animals can.", "The ratio of surface area to body weight is smaller in large animals than it is in small animals.", "There is little variation in the ratio of energy output to body weight among animals.", "The amount of energy needed to run at a given speed is proportional to the surface area of the running animal."]",2,199106_3-LR1_20_21
"The 1980s have been characterized as a period of selfish individualism that threatens the cohesion of society. But this characterization is true of any time. Throughout history all human actions have been motivated by selfishness. When the deeper implications are considered, even the simplest "unselfish" acts prove to be instances of selfish concern for the human species.","Which one of the following is a flaw in the argument?","["The claim that selfishness has been present throughout history is not actually relevant to the argument.", "No statistical evidence is provided to show that humans act selfishly more often than they act unselfishly.", "The argument assumes that selfishness is unique to the present age.", "The argument mentions only humans and does not consider the behavior of other species.", "The argument relies on two different uses of the term \"selfish.\""]",4,199106_3-LR1_21_22

No delay motivated by the journalists' personal or professional interests is permissible. Anita: Well, Marcus, of course interesting and important information should be brought before the public— that is a journalist's job. But in the typical case, where a journalist has some information but is in a quandary about whether it is yet important or "newsworthy," this guidance is inadequate.","In order to conclude properly from Anita's statements that Marcus' general claim about traditional journalistic ethics is incorrect, it would have to be assumed that","["whether a piece of information is or is not newsworthy can raise ethical dilemmas for journalists", "there are circumstances in which it would be ethically wrong for a journalist to go to press with legitimately acquired, newsworthy information", "the most serious professional dilemmas that a journalist is likely to face are not ethical dilemmas", "there are no ethical dilemmas that a journalist is likely to face that would not be conclusively resolved by an adequate system of journalistic ethics", "for a system of journalistic ethics to be adequate it must be able to provide guidance in every case in which a journalist must make a professional decision"]",0,199310_4-LR2_16_19

Such drawing of inspiration does not mean, however, a slavish lack of originality; building according to formulas does not make good buildings.

"Speaker: Contemporary business firms need to recognize that avoiding social responsibility leads to the gradual erosion of power. This is Davis and Blomstrom's Iron Law of Responsibility: "In the long run, those who do not use power in a manner which society considers responsible will tend to lose it." The law's application to human institutions certainly stands confirmed by history.

"In humans, ingested protein is broken down into amino acids, all of which must compete to enter the brain. Subsequent ingestion of sugars leads to the production of insulin, a hormone that breaks down the sugars and also rids the bloodstream of residual amino acids, except for tryptophan. Tryptophan then slips into the brain uncontested and is transformed into the chemical serotonin, increasing the brain's serotonin level. Thus, sugars can play a major role in mood elevation, helping one to feel relaxed and anxiety-free.","Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?","["Elevation of mood and freedom from anxiety require increasing the level of serotonin in the brain.", "Failure to consume foods rich in sugars results in anxiety and a lowering of mood.", "Serotonin can be produced naturally only if tryptophan is present in the bloodstream.", "Increasing the level of serotonin in the brain promotes relaxation and freedom from anxiety.", "The consumption of protein-rich foods results in anxiety and a lowering of mood."]",3,200210_4-LR2_19_21

"One theory to explain the sudden extinction of all dinosaurs points to "drug overdoses" as the cause. Angiosperms, a certain class of plants, first appeared at the time that dinosaurs became extinct. These plants produce amino-acid-based alkaloids that are psychoactive agents. Most plant-eating mammals avoid these potentially lethal poisons because they taste bitter. Moreover, mammals have livers that help detoxify such drugs.

"Zoologist: In the Lake Champlain area, as the North American snowshoe hare population grows, so do the populations of its predators. As predator numbers increase, the hares seek food in more heavily forested areas, which contain less food, and so the hare population declines. Predator populations thus decline, the hare population starts to increase, and the cycle begins again.

"Historian: The Land Party achieved its only national victory in Banestria in 1935. It received most of its support that year in rural and semirural areas, where the bulk of Banestria's population lived at the time. The economic woes of the years surrounding that election hit agricultural and small business interests the hardest, and the Land Party specifically targeted those groups in 1935. I conclude that the success of the Land Party that year was due to the combination of the Land Party's specifically addressing the concerns of these groups and the depth of the economic problems people in these groups were facing.","Each of the following, if true, strengthens the historian's argument EXCEPT:","["In preceding elections the Land Party made no attempt to address the interests of economically distressed urban groups.", "Voters are more likely to vote for a political party that focuses on their problems.", "The Land Party had most of its successes when there was economic distress in the agricultural sector.", "No other major party in Banestria specifically addressed the issues of people who lived in semirural areas in 1935.", "The greater the degree of economic distress someone is in, the more likely that person is to vote."]",2,india2_2-LR1_19_19

"Anthropologist: It has been claimed that religious prohibitions against eating certain types of food are evidence against the belief that all cultural phenomena have a purely economic explanation. After all, the reasoning goes, only a moral or spiritual motive could persuade people to forgo readily available sources of nutrients.

The preservation of the prohibited species thus tends to help preserve the other species. Therefore, such prohibitions do indeed have an economic motivation.","The reasoning in the anthropologist's argument is flawed because the argument","["infers, merely from the claim that a practice has a certain desirable consequence, that this consequence must provide a motivation for the practice", "takes for granted that people could have a reason for adopting a certain policy and nevertheless not realize what that reason is", "infers, merely from the claim that a certain cultural phenomenon has no economic explanation, that the explanation of this phenomenon must be spiritual or moral", "uses the key term \"prohibition\" in two different senses", "draws a conclusion that simply restates a claim presented in support of that conclusion"]",0,india4_2-LR1_8_10

Yet whenever two people exchange gifts of equal value, the gift givers soon realize that they would have done as well to keep their gifts, not give them away. Gift exchange, therefore, invariably results in either social awkwardness or else a useless transfer of commodities. Mili: But that is not true of my experience. For example, an old childhood friend and I recently exchanged presents that I am sure were vastly different in price.

"Economist: When people save their money instead of spending it, that money is not being used to make the purchases of goods and services that help businesses remain profitable. Because these purchases are needed to generate tax revenues that can be used for government-funded scientific research, it is clear that industrial growth, which relies on the application of this government-funded research, will falter if the global political climate begins to make people anxious or cautious.","Which one of the following is an assumption required by the economist's argument?","["People become less inclined to spend their money on goods and services when the global political climate makes them anxious or cautious.", "The purpose of scientific research that is funded by tax money is to lend itself to applications that will sustain industrial growth.", "People are often made anxious and cautious by the global political climate.", "The scientific research that is currently funded by the government will no longer take place if tax revenues decrease.", "People who are more inclined to spend than to save their money are neither cautious nor anxious."]",0,india5_4-LR2_6_6
"Until recently, endosulfan was one of the most widely used pesticides. Some others—toxaphene, dieldrin, and chlordane—were banned or restricted in many countries in the 1980s but linger in the environment. All four have a weak effect individually in increasing estrogen levels in women. Scientists have found, however, that their potential to cause health hazards increases dramatically when the chemicals are combined. For example, a mixture of endosulfan and dieldrin had 160 to 1,600 times more estrogen-boosting potency than either chemical did individually. Increased estrogen is associated with an increased cancer risk in women.","Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?","["Pesticides that boost estrogen levels are more dangerous than others.", "Any two pesticides in combination pose greater health risks than do the same pesticides uncombined.", "Because of its hazards when combined with other chemicals, endosulfan is more dangerous than most other pesticides.", "If certain pesticides combine in the environment, they may constitute greatly increased human health hazards.", "Banning endosulfan worldwide in the 1980s would have had no effect on worldwide cancer rates"]",3,india5_4-LR2_7_7
"Columnist: In a recent article an economist argues that corporations have no responsibility to society beyond obeying the law and maximizing profit for shareholders. But in a different article the same economist endorses the view that corporations ought to make financial contributions to social programs in the communities in which they are located. Thus the economist is caught in a contradiction.","The columnist's argument is questionable because it fails to rule out the possibility that","["corporations make nonfinancial contributions to social programs within their local communities", "many shareholders of corporations are in favor of their corporations making contributions to community social programs", "social programs have an economic effect on a community and are therefore part of the domain of economists", "financial contributions to community social programs improve a corporation's image in a way that improves its profitability", "a corporation's making financial contributions to community social programs violates no laws"]",3,india5_4-LR2_8_8
"While conditions on Mars are no longer favorable for the evolution of life, scientists point out that in many ways Mars resembles portions of Antarctica, which do manage to support colonies of microbes. But these organisms require liquid water, as do all forms of life. And if there is liquid water on Mars at all, it is only seasonal and in small amounts.","The statements above, if true, most strongly support which one of the following?","["If there is no life on Mars, then there is no liquid water on Mars.", "It is unreasonable to suppose that Mars has ever supported any forms of life.", "If there are colonies of microbes in Antarctica, then there are colonies of microbes on Mars.", "If there is life on Mars, then there is liquid water on Mars.", "If there is liquid water on Mars, then there are colonies of microbes on Mars."]",3,india5_4-LR2_9_9
"Politician: The cohesion of a society depends on its members' accepting a set of basic principles. When these principles are routinely called into question, the society begins to erode. Any society, therefore, that allows schools to present the society's set of basic principles as simply one of several alternatives, with the suggestion that students may choose which to accept on the basis of the principles' worth, is inviting its own demise.","Which one of the following would, if true, most strengthen the politician's argument?","["Given the chance to assess the merits of the principles governing their societies, individuals will rarely find those principles acceptable.", "One cannot evaluate a set of political principles without having first established criteria of evaluation.", "Some flourishing societies do not encourage questioning of their most basic principles.", "Children are more likely than adults to question the wisdom of those who founded and shaped a society.", "Unless people believe that they have freely chosen to adopt the principles that govern their societies, they will tend to repudiate these principles."]",0,india5_4-LR2_10_10
"Economist: In general, several apprentices working together produce about the same amount in an hour as a single more highly trained worker. Hence the more highly trained worker can usually command several times the hourly wage of an apprentice. Thus if the apprentice wage is increased, the hourly wages of more highly trained workers will generally rise by a proportionate amount. Therefore the reason that more highly trained workers favor an increased apprentice wage is that it would increase their own wages.","The economist's reasoning is flawed because the economist takes for granted that","["if a policy change that people support would work in their favor, that is why they support it", "if one event causes another event, then the first event occurs whenever the second event occurs", "an increase in the apprentice wage would result in an increase in the wages of all better-paid workers", "the wages of highly trained workers will usually not increase unless the apprentice wage increases", "an increase in the apprentice wage would benefit only highly trained workers"]",0,india5_4-LR2_11_11
"Oxygenated petrol, although it reduces pollution, causes frequent stalling in poorly maintained automobiles. However, in laboratory tests of automobiles that had been driven 100,000 kilometers, those that had regularly used oxygenated petrol stalled less than those that had regularly used nonoxygenated petrol.","Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the results of the laboratory tests described above?","["The adverse effects from oxygenated petrol can be distinguished from mechanical engine problems in the laboratory tests.", "Automobile owners who pay a high price for oxygenated petrol have less money for automobile maintenance than do automobile owners who buy the less expensive nonoxygenated petrol.", "Drivers whose automobiles regularly exhibit adverse effects from oxygenated petrol generally cease to notice the adverse effects by the time their automobiles have been driven 100,000 kilometers.", "In conducting the tests, the laboratory used each type of petrol on each type of engine.", "Automobile owners who regularly use oxygenated petrol get more frequent engine maintenance because of the adverse effects from the petrol."]",4,india5_4-LR2_12_12
"It has been hypothesized that dinosaurs became extinct simply because they grew too large and slow to function effectively as predators, but this cannot be right. If that hypothesis were correct, then small dinosaurs would have survived even though their large counterparts died off.

"If, when the twenty-third century arrives, the history of the Mughal Empire is better known than that of our time, it will be because of our enthusiasm for electronically stored digital files. The contents of most digital media vanish long before words written on high-quality paper would, and they become obsolete and unusable even sooner due to rapid technological innovation. While information written on paper can be read directly, access to digital information is doubly indirect: the sequence of digits representing the information must be retrieved, and then that sequence must be decoded by the appropriate software.","Which one of the following statements most accurately expresses the main conclusion of the argument?","["The obsolescence brought about by ongoing technological innovation will make historical research increasingly difficult in the future.", "Information written on paper is more readily accessible than the contents of digital documents.", "Historically important records from the present era may be lost because of the medium in which they are stored.", "Digitally stored information is particularly vulnerable because of the two-step process required to retrieve it.", "Historians in the future may know more about the Mughal Empire than about the twenty-first century."]",2,india5_4-LR2_14_14
